# EgyptionWar
A program of the Egyption War game automatic simulator.
How it works:
The Egyption War game is based on slaps,who slaps the card pile first(faster reaction time).
In this program,when there is a possible slap,the player that didn't draw the last card is the one "slapping".
And then he draws the next card.
You need to click space as a continue button of each round.
I still have not done it in a small part of the program I think because I was lazy so it might show a couple of rounds toghether.
EgyptionWarHelper is a script with a functions that were used for shorter and readable code in the main file.
It is also the first script I created.
This program is probably not the most efficent but I don't think there is too much to change with the way I approached it.
EDIT:I have created a new file(EgyptianWar.py) with a new EgyptionWarHelper that are much more efficent and readable.
